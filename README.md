URL Parser TDD Kata
===================

Starting point for
[TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
[Code Kata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_\(programming\)).

Dependencies
------------

* Node.js >= 0.10 http://nodejs.org/
* Mocha (install globally for convenience) `sudo npm install -g mocha`
* This repo `git clone https://github.com/epeli/url-parser-tdd-kata`

The Kata
--------

1. Tell Mocha to watch and run tests after every change `mocha -w test.js`
2. Aim for green!

Once done with the pre-written tests, just continue on your own

1. Pick a feature
2. Write a test for main usecase
3. Write just enough implementation to pass the test
4. Refactor the implementation for readability keeping tests green
5. What aspect of the implementation you do not yet trust?  Write test for it and goto step 3.
